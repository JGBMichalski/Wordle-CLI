## Dependencies

`Wordle-CLI` requires [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in order to function correctly. This is due to the use of the new [`match` statements](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html#pep-634-structural-pattern-matching).

---

## Usage
 
To start the game, simply execute `python3 wordle.py` from the root directory.

## Word List

The word list contains `5757` words and comes from [Chaz Reid's Five Letter Words Repo](https://github.com/charlesreid1/five-letter-words). Future updates may include this list being updated to an external API.
