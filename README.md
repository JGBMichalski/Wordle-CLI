## Dependencies

`Wordle-CLI` requires [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) in order to function correctly. This is due to the use of the new [`match` statements](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.10.html#pep-634-structural-pattern-matching).

## Usage
 
To start the game, simply execute `python3 wordle.py` from the root directory.
